description: Shape a vague or underspecified request into a structured proposal with explicit assumptions and next action
argument-hint: [request]
---

Apply the prompt-shaping technique to the following request:

$ARGUMENTS

Follow this process:

1. **Restate in natural language** - Articulate what you understand the user wants, making assumptions explicit
2. **Bullet the structure** - Break the restatement into scannable components
3. **State the next action** - Commit to a concrete step if the interpretation is correct

Before proposing, orient to the environment:
- Scan for existing patterns that inform reasonable defaults
- Note what's present that the proposal should integrate with
- Identify constraints the user may not have stated but likely expects
